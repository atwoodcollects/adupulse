            <p>
              The Cost Estimator uses per-square-foot ranges derived from actual permit data. We segment by ADU type (detached, attached, conversion) and builder type (DIY/homeowner vs. contractor).
            </p>
            <p>
              Town multipliers adjust for local cost-of-living differences. These are calibrated against actual permit costs where available (e.g., Newton permits typically run 15% above the statewide median, Plymouth 5% below).
            </p>
            <p>
              The cost breakdown (Building/Labor 65%, Electrical 10%, Plumbing 12%, HVAC 8%, Permits/Other 5%) represents a typical split based on industry benchmarks for residential construction in Massachusetts. Individual projects may vary significantly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ROI calculator uses conservative assumptions: rental income at 85% of market rate (accounting for vacancies and below-market ADU pricing), property value uplift percentages derived from appraiser estimates for the local market, and assisted living costs at the Massachusetts state average of $6,000/month.

            <p>
              <span className="text-white font-medium">Incomplete cost data:</span> Not all permits include cost information. Some towns report estimated costs, others report actual construction costs, and some omit costs entirely. Where cost is reported as $0 or missing, we exclude it from averages.

            <p>
              <span className="text-white font-medium">Self-reported survey data:</span> The EOHLC survey relies on municipalities self-reporting their ADU activity. Some towns may undercount (especially smaller communities with manual permitting systems) or misclassify permits.

            <p>
              <span className="text-white font-medium">Portal coverage gaps:</span> We currently scrape 11 town portals. The remaining 340+ towns only have survey-level data. We are actively adding new portal integrations.

            <p>
              <span className="text-white font-medium">Permit ≠ Construction:</span> An approved permit does not guarantee the ADU was built. Some permits expire unused. Our data tracks permitting activity, not construction completions.

              <span className="text-white font-medium">Market estimates are illustrative:</span> The ROI calculator, rent projections, and property uplift figures are estimates based on market averages.
